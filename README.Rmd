# THindex

Tumor Heterogeneity Index Estimating

## Concepts

In this package, we use the ecology methods to estimate the Tumor Heterogeneity(TH) based on their mutated loci of variant allele frequencis(VAF).

The inferHeterogeneityPlus estimate the TH based on two different methods in the Package [vegan](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/vegan/vignettes/diversity-vegan.pdf):   

* Diveristy indices
* Taxonomic indices.   
  
See also <http://www.coastalwiki.org/wiki/Measurements_of_biodiversity> for the concepts.


## Installation

You can install the development version of THindex from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("qingjian1991/THindex")
```

## Documentation

The overview of usage could be found at [THindex online vignette](https://rpubs.com/cqj_00/THindex).
